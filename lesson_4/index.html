                    During the struggle for independence, the Ukrainian language became an important tool of resistance.
                    It has was preserved despite bans, neglect, and attempts at assimilation. People realized that the
                    loss of
                    the language meant a loss of identity. Now, when Ukraine is once again defending its territorial
                    integrity, the <span class="underline">language is not only a means of communication, but also a
                        symbol of resistance
                        to aggression</span>.

                    The Ukrainian language is a treasure trove of the nation's cultural heritage. From the works of
                    Taras Shevchenko to modern literature and music, the native language conveys a rich worldview and
                    the wisdom of generations. It is through language that traditions, customs and values that make a
                    nation unique are preserved. By using the Ukrainian language, we keep in touch with our ancestors
                    and continue to create our national culture.

                    It is important to understand that language is not only an instrument of individual identification,
                    but also an important factor in the formation of national unity. The use of the Ukrainian language
                    in everyday life helps to preserve national consciousness. This is especially important for the
                    younger generation that is being formed in an independent Ukraine. The more Ukrainian is spoken in
                    schools, at work, in the media and in culture, the stronger the national identity is consolidated.
                    The Ukrainian language is not just a means of communication, but a symbol of struggle, culture and
                    unity. It is an important element in the revival of national consciousness and the building of an
                    independent Ukraine. Supporting and developing the native language is a way to preserve the identity
                    and cultural heritage of our people.
